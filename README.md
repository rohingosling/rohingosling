### Philosophy

- **Run time configurability**
  - Make everything in production configurable, through a user interface, in real time.
  - Everything should have a user interface, even if it's only a CLI, but everything should have some kind of GUI, TUI, or CLI that either the business users or customers can use to configure intuitively configurable features in production, in real time.
  - If configurable features have customer or reputational impact that requires four or more eyes, build an authorisation queue into your UI, so that business users can make the changes they need from the UI, and authorise from the UI, in real time.   
  - Only new features should require logging projects. Existing features with obvious variability should be variable from the front end, in real time.
  
- **Reporting is a main feature, not an afterthought**
  - Your UI should have some kind of dashboard that shows obvious stats the business users need. *Even* if your UI is a CLI, then, `--stats`. 
  - Sure, you can build fancy PowerBI dashboards and other reporting solutions later, but the base application should ship with a minimal dashboard that the business users can access from the front end.
  - Aside from the value this offers your business users out of the box, it encourages one to design their application data structure in a way that can be reported on, with out system level entity names and abbreviations making their way up to the business users.
